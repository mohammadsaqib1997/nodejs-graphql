Instructions: Please complete the following tasks to the best of your ability. You may use any online resources or documentation that you find necessary. Feel free to ask any clarifying questions if needed.

Task 1: Implement a GraphQL API

Create a Node.js application that sets up a GraphQL API using Apollo Server. The API should have the following functionalities:

-   ~~Query all users: Create a query to retrieve a list of all users from a database. Include pagination and sorting options.~~
-   ~~Query a user: Create a query to retrieve a single user by their ID from the database.~~
-   ~~Create a user: Implement a mutation to create a new user. Validate the input fields, such as username, email, and password.~~
-   ~~Update a user: Implement a mutation to update an existing user by their ID. Only allow authorized users to update their own information.~~
-   ~~Delete a user: Implement a mutation to delete a user by their ID. Only allow authorized users to delete their own account.~~

Task 2: Implement a job queue with Redis

Integrate Redis into your Node.js application to implement a job queue system. The system should have the following features:

-   ~~Job creation: Allow users to create jobs with specific data and enqueue them in the Redis job queue.~~
-   ~~Job processing: Implement a worker that continuously checks the job queue and processes jobs as they become available. Each job should be processed only once.~~
-   ~~Job status and result: Provide an endpoint or GraphQL query to check the status and result of a specific job by its ID.~~

Task 3: Implement caching

Add caching functionality to your Node.js application to improve performance. Use a caching mechanism of your choice (e.g., Redis or in-memory caching) and apply caching to frequently accessed data or expensive operations.

Task 4: Implement logging and error handling

Enhance your Node.js application with proper logging and error handling. Implement a logging mechanism that logs relevant events and errors to a file or a centralized logging system. Ensure that errors are properly handled and appropriate error responses are returned to clients.

Task 5: Deployment and scalability

Prepare your Node.js application for deployment to a production environment. Consider scalability and high availability aspects. Document the steps required to deploy the application, including setting up any necessary infrastructure (such as load balancers or auto-scaling groups) and configuration management.
